## Overview

This repository contains my Data Science Capstone project completed as part of the IBM Data Science Specialization. In this project, I conducted an analysis to assess the likelihood of successful landings for Falcon 9 rockets, enabling SpaceX to reuse them and ultimately reduce the cost of each launch significantly.

## Project Details

- **Course**: Applied Data Science Capstone on Coursera
- **Instructors**: Yan Luo & Joseph Santarcangelo
- **Completion Date**: 9/16/2023

## Project Description

In this capstone, we will predict if the Falcon 9 first stage will land successfully. SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website with a cost of 62 million dollars; other providers cost upward of 165 million dollars each, much of the savings is because SpaceX can reuse the first stage. Therefore if we can determine if the first stage will land, we can determine the cost of a launch. This information can be used if an alternate company wants to bid against SpaceX for a rocket launch. In this lab, you will collect and make sure the data is in the correct format from an API.
